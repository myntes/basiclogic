# cs228-notes

These notes form a concise introductory course on probabilistic graphical models. They are based on Stanford [CS228](http://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/cs228/index.html), taught by [Stefano Ermon](http://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/), and have been written by [Volodymyr Kuleshov](http://www.stanford.edu/~kuleshov), with the [help](https://github.com/ermongroup/cs228-notes/commits/master) of many students and course staff.

This course starts by introducing graphical models from the very basics and concludes by explaining from first principles the [variational auto-encoder](https://ermongroup.github.io/cs228-notes/).

The compiled version is available [here](http://ermongroup.github.io/cs228-notes/).
